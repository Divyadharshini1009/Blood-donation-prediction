### Blood Donation Prediction

This project aims to predict whether a person is likely to donate blood based on their previous donation history using machine learning classification techniques.

### Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following features:

 * Months since Last Donation
 * Number of Donations
 * Total Volume Donated (c.c.)
 * Months since First Donation
 * Made Donation in March 2007` (Target Variable)

### ML Techniques Used

*Logistic Regression
*Decision Tree Classifier
*Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix

---

### Technologies

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas, NumPy
* scikit-learn
* Matplotlib / Seaborn 

### Project Workflow

1. Data Cleaning & Exploration

   * Checked for missing values
   * Visualized distributions and correlations

2. Model Training

   * Split dataset into training and test sets
   * Trained multiple classifiers

3. Evaluation

   * Compared model performance metrics
   * Selected the best model for predictions

### Outcome

The model successfully predicts the likelihood of a future donation, which can help in planning donor outreach programs and blood supply management.
